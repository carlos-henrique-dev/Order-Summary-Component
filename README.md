## Overview

The goal of this challenge was to create a order summary card using. Althogh the challenge allows to use any tool, I decided to challenge my self and use only pure HTML and CSS to see how are my skills since it's been since I've only been using Vue/React and SASS.

## My process

I started by reading all the challenge description. When I understood what was needed to be done, I started by writing the html and adding classes to the elemens.
Once I was satisfied with the HTML structure, I linked the css stylesheet and started with some basic styling mostly using "display" property to set the elements in the right position. Then I added the colors and sizes. And, for the last part I added the custom styles for the interactive elements.

### Built with

- Pure HTML5 markup;
- Pure CSS

### What I learned

This challenge helped me to remember how to define variables in css. An example of it is below:

```css
  :root {
    --pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
  }

  .card {
    background-color: var(--pale-blue);
  }
```

### Continued development

I want to keep learning and improve my HTML skills to write it with better semantic to improve SEO.
And i also want to keep improving my css skills
